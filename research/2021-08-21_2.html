<h2>Release of <em>HSI</em>, a Featherweight Sequence Indexing Toolkit</h2>

<div class="articleContent"><br>
<p>Following the recommendation of friend-of-the-site and master software engineer <a href="https://www.lesica.com/">George Lesica</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/hsi">HSI toolkit</a> has finally flown the nest (*i. e. *, been given its own GitHub branch)!</p>
<p><a href="../images/hsi-gitpage.png"><img class="articlePic" style="width:600px;height:392px;" src="../images/hsi-gitpage.png"></a></p>
<p>I originally developed the Hexi Sequence Index (or He*xxx*i, if you're feeling saucy) as a temporary stand-in for Sean Eddy's Easel tools during a time of Mirage2 development when I was repeatedly downloading, compiling, and destroying Mirage2. Easel provides a much more robust library of sequence parsing and analysis tools than what I have ever needed, so for the sake of reducing compile time I wanted to have a pared-down version of the library containing only the functions required for Mirage2. Specifically, I needed to be able to get metadata about sequence files (*e. g. *, the names and lengths of sequences in a file) and then extract either entire sequences (typically proteins) or portions of sequences (typically chunks of genomic sequence) that I could then stunt on science-style.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, after a week-ish of development, I was so proud of HSI that I simply *had* to let it play in the major leagues (*i. e. *, permanently incorporate into Mirage2). Benchmarking showed that HSI is as good as Easel at their comparable functions, and HSI's significantly reduced scope made it much faster to install -- inital mission accomplished!</p>
<p>I won't bore you with any boring details, but if you find yourself frequently extracting biological sequences from FASTA files then I'll humbly suggest giving my sweet, precious child HSI a try!</p>
